# Garbage-detector
This is the code developed to classify an image of garbage as Trash, Paper or plastic. The photo is generally captured with a Playstation controller, and you need a webcam accesstoo, when you run the code. 'Final_ME_574_proj.ipynb' runs the whole code, but you can check part by part as well. 
'ME574.h5' is the saved model, trained, and user does not need to train. 'Dataset' folder is where all the images needed for training are kept, with classified folders. 
The framework can be used for any image classification development.
