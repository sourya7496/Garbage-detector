# Garbage-detector
This is the code developed to classify an image of garbage as Trash, Paper or plastic. The photo is generally captured with a Playstation controller, and you need a webcam accesstoo, when you run the code. 'Final_ME_574_proj.ipynb' runs the whole code, but you can check part by part as well.
